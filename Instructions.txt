In order to verify the modifications work as expected, run
the benchmarks used (isort, vet20parinum, compitomin, and matrixmult)
or any other benchmark to ensure that the number of branches matches
the default (NOT_TAKEN) mode of EduMIPS64. If the number of branches
match then execution took the same path and since no modifications
were made to how non-branching instructions are executed the results
would be the same.

An alternative is to directly compare the register values, but considering
the number of possible values of m and n and the number of registers this
can be incredibly time consuming.
